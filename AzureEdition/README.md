## Programing Notes:

-No warranties expressed or implied. If something breaks or you get a unexpected Azure bill, it's on you. 

-This project does not target Arc resource types but this will enable Defender CSPM and you will be billed for AWS/GCP resource types that are connected via AWS/GCP Connector. If the in-scope Subscriptions include Arc resources, MDC will still bill you for those resources. 

-This project should not deploy agents to AWS/GCP Virtual Machines/Containers.

-The ChangeTracking solution must be install on the Log Analytics Workspace. 

-Defender for Endpoint needs Endpoint Security Policies for ASR Rules, Firewall, Antivirus, and EDR to achieve the best security outcomes. Leverage the security.microsoft.com portal to configure them.
