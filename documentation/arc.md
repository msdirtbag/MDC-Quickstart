# MDC-Quickstart 2.0

Defender for Servers deployments can be complicated, MDC-Quickstart makes them simple. MDC-Quickstart contains the Arc & Azure Virtual Machine settings needed for a modern Defender for Servers deployment and can be imported in a few minutes with Azure Cloud Shell/Github. 

Background:

The "Arc" edition of MDC-Quickstart is designed for orgs that seek to enable Defender for Servers on their non-Azure server estate. This edition is best deployed to net-new Azure Subscriptions dedicated for Arc usage. 

Once testing is complete, the MDC-Quickstart policies and be duplicated and assigned to Management Groups. (including Tenant Root Group)
