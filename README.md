## Programing Notes:

-No warranties expressed or implied. If something breaks or you get a unexpected Azure bill, it's on you. 

-This project does not target Arc resource types but this will enable Defender CSPM and you will be billed for AWS/GCP resource types that are connected via AWS/GCP Connector. If the in-scope Subscriptions include Arc resources, MDC will still bill you for those resources. 

-This project should not deploy agents to AWS/GCP Virtual Machines/Containers.

-The ChangeTracking solution must be installed on the Log Analytics Workspace prior to deployment. 

-Defender for Endpoint needs Endpoint Security Policies for Attack Surface Reduction Rules, Windows Firewall, Antivirus, and EDR to achieve the best security outcomes. Leverage the security.microsoft.com portal to configure these policies.
